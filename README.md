### User Stories ###

As a user, I should be able to land on the home page and understand what the PostBootCampPlanner is intended for.

As a user, I should be able to sign up, sign in, and fill out a user profile that details the skills I have, want to learn, and overall current goal.

As a user, I should be able to access a daily overview on the 'Home' page. My goal should be listed at the top, with a daily schedule on the left side, along with a calendar of weekly/monthly topics and deliverables. At the bottom should state the time and date, as well as an inspirational quote generated daily.

As a user, I should be able to use "Lessons" to fill out a small form to highlight Topics I've learned and relevant links to lessons, marked complete or not, and ranked. Perhaps, I'll even be able to write some initial notes/thoughts about the learnings for additional information on hover or when sharing to the community. 

As a user, I should be able to search "Resources" for quick, verified help about the topics we're covering. Some suggested resources will be provided (i.e. MDN, GeeksForGeeks, etc.), but I can add custom bookmarks to my own resources page. I can also access resources for children to help inspire and convey what I am learning.

As a user, I should be able to use the "Community" page to message other peers as well as use more networking/community driven content like blogs, Medium, Linkedin, Logrocket blog, etc.

As a user, I should be able to use the "Achievements" page to upload certifications, test scores, project snapshots, etc, to my own page to continually build my positive growth mindset. I can also access links to more learning platforms like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and Hackerrank.
