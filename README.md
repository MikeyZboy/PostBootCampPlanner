### User Stories ###

As a user, I should be able to land on the home page and understand what the ParentPlannerProject is intended for.

As a user, I should be able to sign up, sign in, and fill out a user profile that details the course work and potential resources for me to use.

As a user, I should be able to access a daily overview on the 'Home' page. My goal should be listed at the top, with a daily schedule on the left side, along with a calendar of weekly/monthly topics and deliverables. At the bottom should state the time and date, as well as an inspirational quote generated daily.

As a user, I should be able to use "Lessons" to see past, present, and upcoming lessons - including which ones I've completed and associated homeworks (with a checkbox to mark complete). Maybe even write some initial notes/thoughts about the learnings. 

As a user, I should be able to search "Resources" for quick, verified help about the topics we're covering. Some suggested resources will be provided (i.e. MDN, GeeksForGeeks, etc.), but I can add custom bookmarks to my own resources page. I can also access resources for children to help inspire and convey what I am learning.

As a user, I should be able to use the "Community" page to message other peers as well as use more networking/community driven content like blogs, Medium, Linkedin, Slack groups, etc.

As a user, I should be able to use the "Achievements" page to upload certifications, test scores, project snapshots, etc, to my own page to continually build my positive growth mindset. I can also access links to more learning platforms like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and Hackerrank.
